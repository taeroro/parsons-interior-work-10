            <h2>Cortina is a designer, curator and creative collaborator. </h2>
            <p>
							Her work expresses ideas and emotions prompted by modernity and myth – ‘a search for the harmony and beauty that can be found in conscious and unconscious imaginings.’
							<br /><br />
							Her designs avoid familiar international styles. The spatial arrangements, furniture, and individual objects that she creates produce very specific atmospheres and aesthetics – and they are extremely place-sensitive. Gloria works intensely to curate settings that bring together architecture, design, art and culture in a way that reflects unique lifestyles.

								The Studio’s innovative designs, at every scale, use beautiful and unusual materials. They are all Gloria Cortina originals, produced by the Studio’s team of designers and skilled craftspeople.
								<br /><br />
								The Studio’s work has been featured in publications including Vogue, Architectural Digest, Dezeen, Elle Decoration, Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times. It also appears at major international exhibitions, such as Design Miami, Art Basel, Salon Art + Design New York, MACO, and in solo shows in New York City and México.
								<br /><br />
								Gloria Cortina’s furniture pieces have been purchased and added to the permanent collections of internationally recognized museums and art galleries- these include the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Museum and Denver Art Museum.

								Gloria Cortina’s design inspirations range from Mayan artefacts to Cubism, 20th century Modernism, México’s unique Arts and Crafts heritage, and natural and archaeological environments. These, and other sources, enrich her designs, giving them meaning and a uniquely individual character, balancing warmth and refinement.
								<br /><br />
								Gloria who lives in Mexico City and New York, studied at Parsons The New School for Design graduating from ASS program in 1999, after working with various architects like Ricardo Legorreta and David Ling, she set up her Interior Design studio in 2009.
								<br /><br />
								Gloria Cortina Studio creates dynamic dialogues involving interiors, furniture, fabrics and individual objects, and does so with exceptional attention to detail. The designs are sensually sophisticated, emotionally engaged, and her beautifully crafted spaces and individual pieces have greatly increased international awareness of Mexican culture in contemporary design

              <h1>Acut Residence</h1>
              <p>
								The interiors of the Acut Residence, originally designed in the 1990s, were totally reinvented by Gloria Cortina in a close dialogue with the clients.
								<br />
								The rooms had previously been cluttered and lacked a spatial or aesthetic narrative. The new design scheme is a highly conceptual coming together of art, space, light and shadow.

	                The Cabo Residence is a remarkably bold example of 21st century Modernist architecture. It was designed by Mauricio Gómez de Tuddo, in close collaboration with Gloria Cortina, and they shared ideas about the building’s materials and surfaces, its qualities of space and volume, and artworks.
